# OncoLens

### Project Description
This Python-based application is designed to help researchers at Moffitt Cancer Center analyze and visualize tumor behavior based on tumor growth models. The tool takes in patient biological data, including tumor and treatment history, and enables dynamic adjustments of key parameters related to tumor growth, treatment efficacy, and other factors.

Users can interactively experiment with various settings, such as growth rates and treatment variables, which are fed into a specialized tumor growth model. The application then generates a visual representation of the tumor's growth, plotting predicted growth ranges alongside treatment history. This allows for a comprehensive analysis of the patient's biological dynamics.

The process is iterative, enabling researchers to fine-tune model parameters and explore different scenarios, ultimately enhancing their understanding of tumor behavior and improving the accuracy of growth predictions.
